## Description

An API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list.

This project was built to practice the fundamentals of creating a NoSQL MongoDB database using Mongoose. I practiced creating document schemas, understanding subdocuments and their purposes, and understanding the overall document structure needed to create MERN applications.

## Installation

This application will firstly require a first-time user to create a .env file with a "MONGOURI" variable. This URI will connect the application to a Mongo database. 

Once done, in the terminal, run `npm i` to install the dependendies. Once done, run `npm start` in the terminal to launch the application. This is purely a backend application, so a tool such as Insomnia or Postman will be needed to test routes.

## Usage

CRUD routes for Users and Thoughts can be tested using tools such as Insomnia or Postman.
